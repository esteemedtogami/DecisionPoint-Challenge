This is my coding sample for the DecisionPoint interview process. The work
in this repository, with the exception of Chart.js and Papa Parse, are my
own. Chart.js and Papa Parse are both licensed under the MIT license, which
allows for the commercial and private use, distribution, and modification
of the software. In my case, it is just the use of the software. The min version
of Papa Parse is included in this repo as a resource, and Chart.js is used
with an ajax call.
